# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) I built using React in order to learn the framework.  
The application allows you to create/edit/delete appointments on each day of the week based on the interviewers available for that day.  
Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.  
The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.  

Jest tests, Storybook and Cypress were used through the development of the project for testing. CircleCi runs tests automatically on deployment and pushes tested code to the production branch  

## App is now deployed with Netlify & Heroku, try it live here!

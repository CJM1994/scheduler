# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) I built using React in order to learn the framework.  
Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.  
The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.  
Jest tests, Storybook and Cypress were used through the development of the project for testing.
